## Customization
### Adding Questions
Modify the `setupQuestions` method in the code. Each difficulty level has its own question array. Ensure:
- The first option starts with `y` for the correct answer.
- Other options start with `x`.

**Example**:
```java
easyQuestions[0][0] = "What is 2 + 2?";
easyQuestions[0][1] = "y4";
easyQuestions[0][2] = "x3";
easyQuestions[0][3] = "x5";
easyQuestions[0][4] = "x6";
```

### Map Configuration
You can adjust map features (e.g., number of enemies, shops) by modifying these methods:
- `placeEnemies()`
- `placeShops()`
- `placeFinalBoss()`

---

## Rules
1. Correct answers deal damage to enemies or the final boss.
2. Incorrect answers result in losing health.
3. Level up by gaining 100 experience points:
   - Max health increases by 20.
   - Weapon damage remains unaffected unless upgraded at shops.

---

## Key Functions
### `askQuestion()`
- Selects a random question from the chosen difficulty level(s).
- Randomizes the order of answers.
- Deducts from the total question count.

### `shuffleArray()`
- Shuffles the order of multiple-choice answers.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more complex question logic (e.g., timed responses).
- Support multiplayer mode.
- Expand map and introduce new enemy types.
- Save/load game progress.
